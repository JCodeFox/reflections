7. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In case you want to work with multiple computers or multiple people.

10. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If another user changes the repository on github, you may not want
    the changes to be pulled to your local repository.

14. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones that only effect github.
    Clones are copies of a repository, from github to your local machine
    or from your local machine to somewhere else on the local machine.
    Branches are different versions of the same repository.
    I would use branches to create different versions of the same repository.
    I would use Clones to copy someones repository to my machine.
    I would use a fork to copy someone elses repository on github
    to my own acount on github.

22. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows you to merge them on your own computer and then push them up
    to github.
